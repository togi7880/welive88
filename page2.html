                    Introduction
                <div>This is the Privacy Policy of Doublegoo LLC, (“We Live”, “us”, “we”, or “our”) which is incorporated into and is subject to our Terms of Use. Please read on to learn more about our data handling practices. By visiting our website www.welive.mn (“Site”), or accessing or using our We Live mobile application (“App”) or all of the services available or related to therein (collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as the “Service”), you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service.
</div><div>
</div><div>Age
</div><div>The Service is not directed at children under the age of eighteen (18) and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of eighteen as part of the Service. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received or collected personally identifiable information from a user under the age of eighteen as part of the Service, we will delete such information from our records. If you are under the age of eighteen, please do not use the Service.
</div><div>
</div><div>Information we collect
</div><div>When you use the Site or App, install the App on your device, or sign up for an account with We Live, personally identifiable information about you may be collected in order for us to be able to provide you with the Service. Please see below more details on the types of personally identifiable information that we may collect from you.
</div><div>
</div><div>a. When you visit our Site
</div><div>We may use online tracking technology such as cookies, pixel tags, web beacons and other similar technologies to automatically collect information about:
</div><div>
</div><div>your visits to our Site, such as your browsing history, how long you stay on our Site, and how often you visit; and
</div><div>your location information as provided by your mobile or other device when you interact with our Site, including your IP address and general geographic location; and the device that you use to browse our Site (e.g. your device ID, operating system, type of device, browser type and version, mobile application crashes and other system activity, and third party sites you were using before interacting with our services). You have the right to disable any of these online tracking technologies. To learn more about how we use the above data, please see the Cookie Policy section below.
</div><div>b. During registration
</div><div>When you install the Service on your device and/or register for an account with We Live, personally and/or non-personally identifiable information about you may be collected.
</div><div>Information you provide (mandatory) - You are required to provide your gender, name and date of birth.
</div><div>
</div><div>Information you provide (optional) - You may also choose to provide other personally identifiable information such as your mobile phone, e-mail address, photos or videos of yourself, description of yourself and information about your interests. The provision of such information is entirely optional. If you register and log in using your Facebook, Apple or Google account, we may also collect additional information that you make available to us. For example, if you register with We Live using your Facebook account (e.g. Facebook Connect), we may collect and store your Facebook ID and corresponding token on our servers and, if you give us your express consent, we will have access to and may collect certain information that you make available on Facebook (for example, your first and last names, email address, profile picture, friend lists and birthdays).
</div><div>
</div><div>Your contacts – In addition, you may be asked to provide us with access to your address book on your device(s) on which the App is installed. If you consent, we will have access to the contact information stored in your address book on the device(s) that you use for accessing the App (this may include names, contact numbers, email addresses, profile pictures and Google/Apple/Facebook/Twitter IDs, but this will not include any notes or other personal information stored in your address book) and we will store it on our servers and use it to facilitate your use of the Service. For example, we will synchronize your We Live contacts between different devices which you may use to access our Service. However, you should always seek prior consent from any person whose contact information is stored in your address book before you consent to sharing the contact information of such person with us.
</div><div>
</div><div>c. During usage of the App
</div><div>Device information – We Live may collect and store information about the device(s) which you use to install and access the App, such as your device model, unique device identifier, IP address, device capability and statistics on page views.
</div><div>
</div><div>Your activity - We Live may collect and store information about your and others’ usage of and activity within the App and our Site, including matches, numbers of matches made by members, match durations, text messages, and usage by geographies. You will also have the option to allow us to take pictures and record video/audio, and gain access to your photos, media and files on your device, and your device’s location, while using the App.
</div><div>
</div><div>Content you shared - We Live allows you to share text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and other communications in the App with other users, and if you choose to do so, your text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and other communications will be stored on our servers. In addition, if you choose to share these items with other We Live users, we may not be able to remove them from our servers or make them unavailable to anyone you have shared them with. By choosing to share such information, you agree that you may no longer be able to control how that information is used and that it may become publicly available (depending in part on your actions or the actions of the other users with whom you have shared the information). We Live shall not be responsible for any use or misuse of such information that you share with other users. You may refer to Part 7 below for more information on the parties with whom you may choose to share your content.
</div><div>
</div><div>Content you created - We may also collect and store any user content (e.g. photos, screenshots, comments, and other materials) that you create or post on the App (“User Content”).
</div><div>
</div><div>Error-reporting information – We also collect error-reporting information if the App crashes or fails to operate properly so that we can investigate the error and improve the stability of the App for future releases. In general these reports do not contain personally identifiable information, or only incidentally. These error reports contain information such as the type and version of your device, the device identifier, the time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state of the App when the error occurred. We do not use this information for any purpose other than investigating and fixing the error.
</div><div>
</div><div>Your User Profile
</div><div>The information you provide for your user profile on the App (your “Profile”) may be shared with your We Live contacts. You can access, control and modify your Profile from the App at any time. Your Profile will be made available to other users of the App who are connected to you. In addition, your Profile is discoverable by other App users, for example, through listing of contacts in the App that will include your proximity to other users. You may also choose to “block” any App user in your contact list which will prevent them from discovering your Profile at any time. In addition, We Live may pre-populate your Profile with certain information such as your name and Facebook profile picture if you have logged into your account on the App using your Facebook account.
</div><div>
